# Amazon Web Services

* Elastic: Scale-up and scale-down capabilities
* Elastic Computing
* AWS Customer Success: https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/case-studies/
* Regions and Availability Zones: https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/
  * 17 Geographica Regions
  * GovCloud
  * 46 Availability Zones
  * Edge Locations
* Ephemeral: means temporary
* Ephemeral Storage:
  * Instance store
  * Temporary block-level storage
  * Free storage with an EC2 instance
  * Data is lost when instance is *terminated* or *stopped*
  * No SLA, access speed is not guaranteed
  * Ideal for temporary data such as: Buffers, caches, scratch data, etc..
  * Replicated data for load-balanced web servers
## Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)
### EC2 Basics
* Think of EC2 as your basic desktop computer at Amazon cloud. EC2 provides scalable computing capacity. The following is an overly-simplified comparison:
  * Thinks of OVA, OVF as AMIs (Amazon Machine Images)
  * Think of CPU as “Instance type”
  * EBS as Hard Drive
  * Network card as IP addressing
  * Firewall as Security Groups
  * RAM as RAM
  * Delegated Administration as Identity and Access Management (IAM)
  * DNS as Route 53
  * Load Balancer as ELB
* Most Common EC2 Instance Purchasing Options
  * On-Demand: The most expensive (billed hourly); the most flexible
  * Reserved: 1 year or 3 years; significant price discount over using on-demand
  * Spot: the price is away for you to “bid” on an instance type and only pay for and use that instance when the spot price is equal or below your “bid” price
    * Provisioned instances automatically terminate when the spot price greater than your bid price
    * Allow Amazon to sell the use of “unused instances”
    * You are charged by minutes
## Amazon Simple Storage Service S3
* First AWS service introduced in 2006
* Internet accessible storage via HTTP/HTTPS
* Store video, images, backup etc..
* Unlimited bucket size
* Up to 5 TB object size
* Priced on storage used and transfer in an out.
  * https://aws.amazon.com/s3/pricing/
* It's not a file system
  * Because Amazon doesn't want to to map the S3 as a drive
  * What is a good use for S3?
    * Netflix delivers billions of hours of content to customers around the world from Amazon S3. S3 also serves as the data lake for their big data analytics solution.
* Storage Classes:
A storage class represents the “classification” assigned to each Object in S3. Each object must be assigned to a storage class. Available Storage classes include:

  * Standard: is the default class; The most expansive storage class
    * Object Durability: 99.999999999% (eleven nines)
    * Object Availability: 99.99%
  * Reduced Redundancy Storage (RRS): for objects that are easily reproducible
    * Object Durability: 99.99%
    * Object Availability: 99.99%
  * Infrequent Access (S3-IA)
    * Object Durability: 99.999999999%
    * Object Availability: 99.90%
  * Glacier: The cheapest S3 storage; very good for long-term archive;
    * 99.999999999% Object Durability; The only way to set an object's storage class to Glacier is through object lifecycles
    * Using RESTful APIs to target for backups
* **Object Durability:** % over one-year time period that a file stored in S3 will NOT be lost. For example, for object durability of 99.999999999% that means there is a 0.000000001% chance of a file in S3 being lost in a year.
* **Object Availability:** % over a one-year time period that a file stored in S3 WILL be accessible
*Object Versioning
  * S3 versioning is a feature that keeps track of and store all old/new versions of an object
  that you can access and use an older version if you like.
  * Versioning is either ON or OFF which by default is OFF
  * Once it is turned on, you can only “suspend” versioning. It cannot be fully OFF
  * Suspending versioning only prevents versioning going forward
  * Versioning can only be set on the bucket level and applies to ALL objects in the bucket
## Elastic Block Store (EBS)
* EBS is a storage volume for an EC2 instance
* Not internet accessible
* Does not need to be attached to an instance
* Can be transferred between Availability Zones
* IOPS: Input/Output Operations per Second: The amount of data that can
be written to or retrieved from an EBS per second
* Root vs Additional EBS Volumes: Every EC2 instance MUST have a “root” volume which may or may not be EBS
* During the creation of an EC2 instance or anytime afterwards you can add additional EBS Volumes to the instance
* Snapshots:
  * Snapshot is an “image” of an EBS volume that can be stored as a backup of the volume OR used to create a duplicate
  * A snapshot is NOT an active EBS volume. You cannot attach or detach a snapshot to an EC2 instance
  * To restore a snapshot, you need to create a new EBS volume using the snapshot as is template
